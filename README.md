# Listify Clone Project

This project is a clone of the webpage Listify Classic (https://listify-demos.astoundify.com/classic). It has been created purely for practice purposes as part of a learning exercise.

Description
The page replicates the design and layout of the Listify Classic demo. The goal of this project was to improve my front-end development skills by recreating a professional website using HTML and CSS.

Please note that this project is not for commercial use and is only intended for educational purposes.
